/**
 * The heart of the game itself. You should do ALL initialisation required 
 * for the game in here or call function required for that purpose. For example
 * both players should be initialised from here, you should seed the random 
 * number generator, that kind of thing. 
 *
 * Next, you should set the initial player - the initial player is the player 
 * whose token was set by initialisation to RED. 
 *
 * Next, you will need to manage the game loop in here. In each loop of the 
 * game, you should display the game board, including player scores 
 * display whose turn it is, etc in the format specified in the assignment
 * specification. Finally at the end of each turn you will calculate the score 
 * for each player you will calculate their score and store it and then you 
 * will need to swap the current player and other player 
 * using the swap_player() function. 
 * 
 * A game will end when either player presses enter or ctrl-d on a newline. 
 * 
 * When you detect a request to end the game, you should do a final calculation
 * of the scores for the two players and return the player with the highest
 * score.
